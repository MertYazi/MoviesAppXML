It's a demo project to display popular movies and track down the upcoming movies. Users can add movies to favorites for reminders.<br /><br />
Project is written in Kotlin.ðŸ’¯

<br />

| Mode  | Movies | Favorites | Details |
|------|------|------|------|
| Dark | <img src="screenshots/movies_dark_portrait.jpg" width="275"> | <img src="screenshots/favorites_dark_portrait.jpg" width="275"> | <img src="screenshots/details_dark_portrait.jpg" width="275"> |
| Light | <img src="screenshots/movies_light_portrait.jpg" width="275"> | <img src="screenshots/favorites_light_portrait.jpg" width="275"> | <img src="screenshots/details_light_portrait.jpg" width="275"> |

### The Aim Of The Project
Implementing new technologies and best practices in android development such as:
- [Clean Architecture](https://medium.com/android-dev-hacks/detailed-guide-on-android-clean-architecture-9eab262a9011) - Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels.<br /><br />
- [SOLID](https://medium.com/the-android-caf%C3%A9/solid-principles-the-kotlin-way-ff717c0d60da) - SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.<br /><br />
- [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes.<br /><br />
- [HILT](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.<br /><br />
- [Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)  - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.<br /><br />
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - In addition to opening the doors to asynchronous programming, coroutines also provide a wealth of other possibilities, such as concurrency and actors.<br /><br />
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. Retrofit turns your HTTP API into a Java interface.<br /><br />
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.<br /><br />
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module.<br /><br />
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
